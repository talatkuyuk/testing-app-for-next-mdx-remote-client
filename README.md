# testing app for `next-mdx-remote-client`

It is a `nextjs` application for testing of `next-mdx-remote-client`'s features. 

The `nextjs` is one of the React Framework for the Web.

The `next-mdx-remote-client` is a package for compiling and running any MDX content for `nextjs` applications. It uses `@mdx-js/mdx` and `@mdx-js/react` in background.

This application is not just a blog application, resulting comparable outputs in two columns of table for `MDXClient` and `hydrate` for "pages" router, `MDXRemote` and `evaluate` for "app" router. The application employs both "app" router and "pages" router to test and see the exact same results with `next-mdx-remote-client`.
